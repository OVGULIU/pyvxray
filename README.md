# pyvXRAY

**An ABAQUS plug-in for the creation of virtual x-rays from 3D finite element bone/implant models**

## Requirements

### Software requirements

* ABAQUS >= 6.11
* Python Image Library (PIL) >= 1.1.6

**NOTES:**

1.  ABAQUS is a commerical software package and requires a license from [Simulia](http://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/overview/)
2.  The authors of pyvXRAY are not associated with ABAQUS/Simulia 
3.  Python and numpy are heavily used by pyvXRAY. These are built in to ABAQUS. All of the last few releases (v6.11-v6.13) use Python 2.6 and numpy 1.4

For building cython modules from source (e.g. if not using versions with pre-built modules):
* A c compiler. The msvc compiler works best on Windows.
* Cython >= 0.17. This is optional, as c files generated by Cython are provided

### Model setup requirements

* The model must contain only linear or quadrilateral tetrahedral elements (ABAQUS element types C3D4 and C3D10, respectively)
* The model must have a scalar fieldoutput variable representing bone density. This is typically a state variable such as SDV1
* This scalar variable must be available in the last frame of each step to be analysed, as only the last frame is used.
