The pyvXRAY source distribution was built using the following procedure:
1. Open command prompt and go to pyvXRAY directory
2. Create cythonMods.c file: 
   $ cd cython
   $ cython cythonMods.pyx
3. Build the source distribution
   $ cd..
   $ python setup.py sdist

The pyvXRAY binary distribution was then built using the following procedure:

   $ abaqus python setup.py bdist 

The binary distribution is made available for 64-bit Windows only. The same 
command may be used for 32-bit windows. It may also be done using a stand 
alone Python using the following command:

   $ python setup.py build_ext --compiler=msvc bdist 
   
To do this, the stand alone python installation must use the same Python 
and numpy versions used in ABAQUS. This is typically Python 2.6 and numpy 1.4.
The mingw32 compiler option may also be used if using a stand alone python
installation, but not otherwise.

NOTES: 
1. When creating binary distribution using abaqus python, the --compiler 
   option is not available. It will automatically use msvc if installed and
   give an error otherwise.
2. setup.cfg was used with the following settings:
   [install] 
   install_lib=abaqus_plugins
3. To upload to PyPi, use the following command:
   $ abaqus python setup.py sdist upload
4. For some reason, PyPi doesn't like my binary distributions. Perhaps because
   it does not use the standard install directory. Therefore, binaries are
   manually uploaded to https://code.google.com/p/pyvxray/
